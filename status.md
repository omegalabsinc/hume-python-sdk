# Websockets Upgrade Status Report

## Overview
Successfully upgraded the websockets dependency from version 12.0 to 14.1 in the Hume Python SDK. This upgrade involved several changes to maintain compatibility with the new websockets API while preserving functionality.

## Changes Made

### Dependency Update
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to specify websockets version 14.1
- Changed from fixed version (`"12.0"`) to exact version (`"14.1"`)

### API Compatibility Changes
1. Updated connection parameters:
   - Changed `extra_headers` to `additional_headers` in websocket connection calls
   - Updated both chat and stream socket clients to use the new parameter name

2. Updated protocol imports:
   - Removed deprecated `websockets.legacy` imports
   - Switched from `WebSocketClientProtocol` to `Connection` from `websockets.connection`
   - Updated type hints in both `ChatWebsocketConnection` and `StreamWebsocketConnection` classes

3. Exception handling:
   - Updated to use `websockets.exceptions.WebSocketException`
   - Added fallback status code handling for exceptions

## Files Modified
- `pyproject.toml`
- `src/hume/empathic_voice/chat/socket_client.py`
- `src/hume/expression_measurement/stream/socket_client.py`

## Testing
- All websocket-related tests passing
- Verified both basic chat and stream model connections
- Confirmed compatibility with the new websockets API

## Remaining Considerations
- There is a deprecation warning from `websockets.connection` suggesting future migration to `websockets.protocol`
- This warning is from the websockets library itself and may need to be addressed in a future update

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for any issues with the new websockets version in production
2. Plan for future migration to `websockets.protocol` when the deprecation period ends
3. Consider updating other dependencies that might be affected by this change

## Status: âœ… Complete
All changes have been implemented and tested successfully. The SDK is now using websockets 14.1 with all core functionality maintained.
